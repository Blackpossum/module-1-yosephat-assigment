            <h2> what animal is that ?</h2>
        <P> According to wikipedia, <b>The koala</b> <i>(Phascolarctos cinereus)</i>, sometimes called koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions,
            <b>inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</b> It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.
            The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.</P>
        <p>The word koala comes from the Dharug gula, meaning no water. Although the vowel 'u' was originally written in the English orthography as "oo" (in spellings such as coola or koolah — two syllables), the spelling later became "oa" and the word is now pronounced in three syllables, possibly in error.Adopted by white settlers, <b>"koala"</b> became one of several hundred Aboriginal loan words in Australian English, where it was also commonly referred to as <i>"native bear"</i>,[5] later <i>"koala bear"</i>, for its supposed resemblance to a bear.
            It is also one of several Aboriginal words that made it into International English, alongside e.g. <i>"didgeridoo" and "kangaroo."</i> The generic name, <b><i>Phascolarctos</i></b>, is derived from the Greek words <i>phaskolos "pouch" and arktos "bear"</i>. 
            The specific name, cinereus, is Latin for "ash coloured".</p>

            <h2>Distribution & habitat</h2>
            <P>The koala's geographic range covers roughly <b>1,000,000 km2 (390,000 sq mi)</b>, and 30 ecoregions. It ranges throughout mainland eastern and southeastern Australia, including the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The koala was also introduced to several nearby islands. The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range. Fossil evidence shows that the koala's range stretched as far west as southwestern Western Australia during the late Pleistocene. They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes and hunting by Indigenous Australians. 12–13  Koalas were introduced to Western Australia at Yanchep in 2022. Koalas can be found in both tropical and temperate habitats ranging from dense woodlands to more spaced-out forests.In semi-arid climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.</P>

                <h1>1.Koala mean No drink</h1>
                <p>The word "koala" is thought to originate from one of the Australian Aboriginal languages, Dharug, which roughly translates to ‘no drink’ or ‘no water’. And this might explain why. In the Australian bush, koalas rarely drink water as the majority of their water intake comes from eating fresh eucalyptus leaves. Koalas drinking water is uncommon in the wild, although they can do so if necessary, especially during heat waves, droughts or bushfires.</p>
