## My Bio :pencil2:

hi!, my name is prasta, im a Mechanical engineer.

<img src="assets/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-10-10%20at%2016.24.56.jpeg" width=40%> 

Iam an expirienced for almost 3 years as `Mechanical Engineer`, my main focus is on sparepart replacement and mechanical configuration.Im now currently working in paper and forestry industry, and now , im starting a new journey to Learn about `software Engineering` field in __RevoU__ bootcamp Academy.
* __how i end up here__ :
starting from working project with overseas vendor,
installing a new software integrated machine, i was blown away with the complexity of the installation.
from there i start noticing engineering in different prespective, that machine in near future cannot operate just by transfering energy from one motion to become another motion anymore<br>
`the future` is about how to build an integrated system that can works with machine part dynamicaly to increase output rate, seeing this if i only look and dont improve i will be left behind technology, thats why im here.
